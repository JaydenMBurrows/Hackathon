We started out this game trying to make something similar in concept to Guitar Hero or Dance Dance Revolution in concept. 
The main idea is that the user will try to hit the right notes by typing the corresponding letter. 
If the music note gets to the band, then the game ends. 
For this game, we had to learn JavaScript (for the game animation) and GitHub (for collaborating on the same repo). 
We also had to integrate our GitHub accounts and repo with our VSCode, so we could all edit the files and commit our changes that way.

We struggled learning these new tools, so we only finished about 80% of our general idea (missing score, missing another level, missing the guitar fret board, and having a few bugs), but we consider this successful.
When we started, we had little to no experience with GitHub commits or JavaScript (for game development).
